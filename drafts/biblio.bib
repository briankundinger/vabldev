	abstract = {The bipartite record linkage task consists of merging two disparate datafiles containing information on two overlapping sets of entities. This is nontrivial in the absence of unique identifiers and it is important for a wide variety of applications given that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine information from different sources. Most statistical techniques currently used for record linkage are derived from a seminal article by Fellegi and Sunter in 1969. These techniques usually assume independence in the matching statuses of record pairs to derive estimation procedures and optimal point estimators. We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable and instead target a bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our parameter of interest. Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on the matching decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the bipartite matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record linkage using a variety of challenging scenarios and show that it outperforms the traditional methodology. We illustrate the advantages of our methods merging two datafiles on casualties from the civil war of El Salvador. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is developed to provide a theoretical framework for a computer-oriented solution to the problem of recognizing those records in two files which represent identical persons, objects or events (said to be matched). A comparison is to be made between the recorded characteristics and values in two records (one from each file) and a decision made as to whether or not the members of the comparison-pair represent the same person or event, or whether there is insufficient evidence to justify either of these decisions at stipulated levels of error. These three decisions are referred to as link (A 1), a non-link (A 3), and a possible link (A 2). The first two decisions are called positive dispositions. The two types of error are defined as the error of the decision A 1 when the members of the comparison pair are in fact unmatched, and the error of the decision A 3 when the members of the comparison pair are, in fact matched. The probabilities of these errors are defined as and respectively where u(γ), m(γ) are the probabilities of realizing γ (a comparison vector whose components are the coded agreements and disagreements on each characteristic) for unmatched and matched record pairs respectively. The summation is over the whole comparison space r of possible realizations. A linkage rule assigns probabilities P(A 1{\textbar}γ), and P(A 2{\textbar}γ), and P(A 3{\textbar}γ) to each possible realization of γ ε Γ. An optimal linkage rule L (μ, λ, Γ) is defined for each value of (μ, λ) as the rule that minimizes P(A 2) at those error levels. In other words, for fixed levels of error, the rule minimizes the probability of failing to make positive dispositions. A theorem describing the construction and properties of the optimal linkage rule and two corollaries to the theorem which make it a practical working tool are given.},

	abstract = {We propose an unsupervised approach for linking records across arbitrarily many files, while simultaneously detecting duplicate records within files. Our key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually), and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing procedures such as logistic regression, capture–recapture, etc. Our linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.

	abstract = {The goal of record linkage is to link quickly and accurately records that correspond to the same person or entity. Whereas certain patterns of agreements and disagreements on variables are more likely among records pertaining to a single person than among records for different people, the observed patterns for pairs of records can be viewed as arising from a mixture of matches and nonmatches. Mixture model estimates can be used to partition record pairs into two or more groups that can be labeled as probable matches (links) and probable nonmatches (nonlinks). A method is proposed and illustrated that uses marginal information in the database to select mixture models, identifies sets of records for clerks to review based on the models and marginal information, incorporates clerically reviewed data, as they become available, into estimates of model parameters, and classifies pairs as links, nonlinks, or in need of further clerical review. The procedure is illustrated with five datasets from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. It appears to be robust to variations in record-linkage sites. The clerical review corrects classifications of some pairs directly and leads to changes in classification of others through reestimation of mixture models.},

Privacy and confidentiality are of great concern when such data is being shared between organisations or made publicly available. Research in (privacy-preserving) data mining and data linkage is suffering from a lack of publicly available real-world data sets that contain personal information, and therefore experimental evaluations can be difficult to conduct. In order to overcome this problem, we have developed a data generator that allows flexible creation of synthetic data containing personal information with realistic characteristics, such as frequency distributions, attribute dependencies, and error probabilities. Our generator significantly improves earlier approaches, and allows the generation of data for individuals, families and households.",
